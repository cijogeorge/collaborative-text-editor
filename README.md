## A Real-time Collaborative Text Editor

This was a project that I did in 2008 during my Bachelors. Below is the abstract of the work taken from the project report.

### Abstract

The project aims at designing a text editor which allows more than two people to edit the same text from different locations in a network. The project mainly focuses at providing a non-web based peer-to-peer editing application for the collaborative text editing needs of people connected through a Local Area Network. The application will be operational in the ‘GNU/Linux’ platform and is implemented using the various modules of ‘PERL’ programming language. The ‘udp’ protocol is used to send data over the network.

The basic application serves as a usual text editor with various text editing features. In addition to these, the editing application will also feature an option to ‘collaborate’ with other users in the network who are using the same application. This option allows the main user to list the IPs of users with whom he wants to collaborate. Upon filling inputting the required details for collaborating, each editor is connected with one another in a peer-to-peer fashion, after asking for confirmation from the users whose IPs have been entered. The text typed in by any user after this will be updated in ‘real time in all other editors. Each user will be working on his own copy of the file which he can save in his system at any time.
